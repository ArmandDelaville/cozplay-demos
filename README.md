# Cozplay
Team Cozplay was a group of five graduate students at the [Entertainment Technology Center](http://www.etc.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University who spent an entire semester working with Anki's [Cozmo](http://www.etc.cmu.edu/) robot. The goal of this project was to use the Cozmo SDK to create new games for Cozmo with the primary focus being to take advantage of Cozmo's capabilities in unique and engaging ways.
